# 🧠 Prototype MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an innovative open-source framework designed to revolutionize how AI models maintain and manage contextual information during conversations. By implementing a standardized protocol for context handling, MCP enables more consistent, accurate, and personalized AI interactions.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Dynamic Context Management**: Real-time updating and retrieval of conversation context
- **Memory Persistence**: Long-term storage of relevant user information and preferences
- **Relationship Mapping**: Advanced entity relationship tracking and graph-based context representation
- **Privacy-First Design**: Built-in privacy controls and data management features
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle millions of concurrent conversations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- PostgreSQL >= 14.0
- Redis >= 6.0

### Installation

```bash
npm install @mcp/core
npm install @mcp/server
npm install @mcp/client
```

### Quick Start

```javascript
const { MCPServer } = require('@mcp/server');
const { ContextManager } = require('@mcp/core');

// Initialize the MCP server
const server = new MCPServer({
  port: 3000,
  storage: {
    type: 'postgresql',
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
  }
});

// Start listening for connections
server.start();
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

MCP uses a distributed architecture with three main components:

1. **Core Engine**: Handles context processing and memory management
2. **Server Layer**: Manages API endpoints and client connections
3. **Client SDK**: Provides easy integration for applications

## 📊 Performance

- Handles 10,000+ concurrent connections
- Sub-10ms context retrieval time
- 99.99% uptime guarantee
- Automatic scaling and load balancing

## 🔒 Security

- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- GDPR and CCPA compliant
- Regular security audits
