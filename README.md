## üî• A Poetic Tribute to Fireship's Git Course

```
In the realm of code where versions dance,
Fireship lights the way, gives us a chance
To master Git with speed and style,
Making complex concepts worth our while.

"git init" starts our journey bright,
Through branches, merges, day and night.
Commits like snapshots in the flow,
Each change tracked as we learn and grow.

Pull requests and forks galore,
Collaboration at its core.
Merge conflicts? Don't you fret!
Fireship's got techniques you won't forget.

With humor sharp and pace so quick,
Complex concepts finally stick.
From local repos to GitHub's height,
Everything's explained just right.

So here's to Fireship's blazing trail,
Making Git skills prevail.
In ten minutes or even less,
Taking us from stress to success!
```
